Or
DM-IRCTCi

Caution : this can be caught if checker checks your ticket thoroughly or already know the trick.
Also do not make fake ticket a confirm ticket because TT has chart with them. This works best for waiting room or waiting list tickets as these are not matched with chart. You can convert your sleeper ticket to first class and wait in 1st class waiting room. The guy outside waiting room or TT usually does not know that much about cell phones. 
Also use basic phone if possible as it only shows contact name above sms. There are some phones which show mobile number with contact name above sms, avoid them as they can be easily caught.

Following are some sms ticket formats, modify them according to your need. You will need to change details like train number,Departure time, Class, fare details etc. But all of this information can be easily found on websites.
