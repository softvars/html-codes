SMS tickets

You can save paper and travel with the SMS sent to your mobile number when you book tickets online.  This only works if you have an Indian mobile number.

The confirmation SMS is unfortunately rather cryptic.  This is the format in which it appears:

<PNR Number><Train Number><Date of Journey><Departure Time><Class><Codes of Origin and Destination Stations><Name of First Passenger><Coach and Seat Numbers><Fare>

The name of the train is not mentioned.  The names of the stations aren't mentioned either - their respective station codes are mentioned.  

The SMS that I received when I booked the e-ticket in the previous section was as follows:

PNR:4501508534,TRAIN:16558,DOJ:23-09-2013,TIME:11:30,2S,SBC TO KGI,Old Guy,D1 67,FARE:35,SC:11.24+PG CHGS.

If there is more than one passenger travelling, the SMS will mention the name of the first passenger followed by a plus and the number of extra passengers.  For example, if three passengers were travelling, this message would read "Old Guy +2" and mention their coach and seat numbers as well.  If the ticket is RAC/waitlisted, the ticket will only mention the running RAC/waitlist number.
